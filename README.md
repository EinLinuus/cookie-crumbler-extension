# Cookie Crumbler

Make surfing the web fun again by hiding all those stupid cookie banners!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This extension actively interacts with the DOM (to reject cookie banners) and injects CSS (to hide cookie banners).
> Though it's heavily tested, it may not work on every website and may cause issues on some websites.
> If you encounter any issue, please open an issue on GitHub.
> **Make sure to disable this extension on websites where it causes issues before reaching out to the developers of the website.**
